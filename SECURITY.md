# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project heavily relies on Swift macro feature which is available from Swift 5.9. 
Backward compatibility and security updates are not planned yet. 
Once we add support for such compatibility, the list will be updated here.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.9     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 5.9   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Swift macros may expose security vulnerability by injecting custom code into your project 
although we remain careful accepting pull requests. You can also expand and check all macros 
that are shipped with this package.

To report a security vulnerability, email at [info@rayhannabi.com](mailto:info@rayhannabi.com)
